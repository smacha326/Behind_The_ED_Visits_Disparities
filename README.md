# Emergency Department (ED) Usage & Healthcare Disparities in the U.S.

This Power BI project explores patterns in Emergency Department visits across the United States, with a focus on health disparities related to race, age, income, insurance coverage, and access to primary care.

## Project Objective

The project aims to understand why **Black American women aged 65 and older in the Southern U.S.** are the most frequent visitors to emergency departments. It dives deeper into the impact of disease prevalence, healthcare provider shortages, and insurance status on ED usage.

## ðŸ“‚ Contents

- **Dashboard Overview**  
  An interactive Power BI report with filters, navigation buttons, and summary visuals

- **Key Visuals**
  - ED visits by race, gender, and region
  - Death rates from heart disease and cancer by age and sex
  - Insurance coverage by state and demographic group
  - Provider-to-population ratios from MUA data (HRSA)
  - Trends showing correlation between provider access and ED usage

- **Table of Contents Navigation**  
  Page navigation is built into the report using Power BI buttons for easy user flow.

## Data Sources

- **CDC** â€“ Mortality data and chronic disease prevalence  
- **HRSA (Health Resources and Services Administration)** â€“ Medically Underserved Areas (MUAs) and provider access  
- **U.S. Census Bureau** â€“ Insurance coverage and demographic breakdowns  
- **Power BI** â€“ Custom DAX and Power Query transformations

## Key Insights

- **Heart disease** is the leading cause of death in adults 65+, with **cancer** slightly higher in older women.
- **Black Americans** and **multiracial individuals** show the highest prevalence of heart disease.
- **Southern states**, while having the lowest uninsured rates overall, show high ED usage due to provider shortages.
- **Texas** has the highest number of uninsured people.
- **Hispanic individuals** have the highest uninsured rates, yet **Black women aged 65+** have the most ED visits.
- Limited access to primary care and low income strongly correlate with increased ED usage.

## Tools Used

- Power BI Desktop  
- DAX for calculated measures  
- Power Query for data cleaning
